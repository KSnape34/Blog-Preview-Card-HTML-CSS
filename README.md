## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) - For Fonts


### What I learned

Using the :root method in my CSS stylesheet was very useful. It was suggested to me by another developer in the mentor community and it really helped keep track of the main colors and fonts I needed to use for the project.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```CSS
:root{
    --clr-Yellow: #f4d04e;
    --clr-White: #ffffff;
    --clr-Grey: #808080;
    --clr-Black: #121212;

    --ff-main: "Figtree", sans-serif;
    --fs-main: 16px;
    --fw-600: 600;
    --fw-800: 800;
}
```


### Useful resources
